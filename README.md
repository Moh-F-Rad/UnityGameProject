This is game project created in order to be submitted as "CP4471 Emerging Trends in Software" course project.

====================================== INSTRUCTIONS ===================================================
The basic rule is that you change up through the gears as the speed of the car increases.
If you'r looking for the best records, try to shift gears up when the tachometer is around 7,000 RPMs (not easy!).

After some experience with driving this Racing Car, you'll be able to figure out when to shift by the way your engine sounds.

Use "Space bar" to begin the race, and to shift the gear up!
Don't forget to turn on your speakers! Enjoy
